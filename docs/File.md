# File

This object represents a file ready to be downloaded. The file can be downloaded via the link `https://api.telegram.org/file/bot<token>/<file_path>`. It is guaranteed that the link will be valid for at least 1 hour. When the link expires, a new one can be requested by calling [getFile](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#getfile).  The maximum file size to download is 20 MB

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**file_id** | **str** | Identifier for this file, which can be used to download or reuse the file | 
**file_unique_id** | **str** | Unique identifier for this file, which is supposed to be the same over time and for different bots. Can&#39;t be used to download or reuse the file. | 
**file_size** | **int** | *Optional*. File size in bytes. It can be bigger than 2^31 and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a signed 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this value. | [optional] 
**file_path** | **str** | *Optional*. File path. Use &#x60;https://api.telegram.org/file/bot&lt;token&gt;/&lt;file_path&gt;&#x60; to get the file. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from tele_rest.models.file import File

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of File from a JSON string
file_instance = File.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(File.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
file_dict = file_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of File from a dict
file_from_dict = File.from_dict(file_dict)
```
