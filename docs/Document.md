# Document

This object represents a general file (as opposed to [photos](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#photosize), [voice messages](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#voice) and [audio files](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#audio)).

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**file_id** | **str** | Identifier for this file, which can be used to download or reuse the file | 
**file_unique_id** | **str** | Unique identifier for this file, which is supposed to be the same over time and for different bots. Can&#39;t be used to download or reuse the file. | 
**thumbnail** | [**PhotoSize**](PhotoSize.md) |  | [optional] 
**file_name** | **str** | *Optional*. Original filename as defined by the sender | [optional] 
**mime_type** | **str** | *Optional*. MIME type of the file as defined by the sender | [optional] 
**file_size** | **int** | *Optional*. File size in bytes. It can be bigger than 2^31 and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a signed 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this value. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from tele_rest.models.document import Document

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Document from a JSON string
document_instance = Document.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Document.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
document_dict = document_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Document from a dict
document_from_dict = Document.from_dict(document_dict)
